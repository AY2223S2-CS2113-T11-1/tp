## Summary of Contributions

### Base Code: Contributed code from iP Duke bot to serve as a base to work upon.
- Justification: Duck is an improved version of the Duke bot, building upon the pre-existing functionality of Duke with enhanced features like date/time tracking, as well as a new school class scheduler. As such, it made sense to reuse code from the iP and add in features from there.

### New Feature: Implementation of the School Class Task
